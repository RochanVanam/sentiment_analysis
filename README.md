# Sentiment Analysis Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network
## Overview
This sentiment analysis program utilizes a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze the sentiment of textual data. The CNN architecture is designed to extract features from input text and make predictions about the sentiment expressed in the text. To run the program, follow the instructions below.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup4
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- TensorFlow-Datasets
[!TIP]
All required libraries and frameworks can be found at the top of ```sentiment_analysis.py```.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
``` git clone ```

## Usage
1. Make sure you have all the requirements properly installed.
2. Run ```sentiment_analysis.py```.
3. The program will prompt you for a phrase for sentiment analysis. Enter a phrase.
4. To stop the program, simply stop running it or exit the program.

## Data
The program uses a dataset ```train.csv``` located in the ```data/``` directory. It is a csv file containing millions of tweets and their sentiments.
